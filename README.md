# towards-analytic-pulsed-CEST

This is the code for the paper Daniel F. Gochberg, Mark D. Does, Zhongliang Zu, Christopher L. Lankford. Towards an analytic solution for pulsed CEST. NMR in Biomedicine (2017).  Please reference the paper if you use the code for a publication or presentation, as appropriate.  Thanks.

To create the figures in the paper, run the corresponding Matlab code (in the Matlab_code folder).  For example, figure2.m will create figure 2 from the paper.

The Mathematica code (in the Mathematica_code folder) derives the corresponding equations, as discussed in the paper.  For example, equantion17.nb will derive equation 17 from the paper.  The subfolder pdfsOfMathematicaCode provides pdf versions.
